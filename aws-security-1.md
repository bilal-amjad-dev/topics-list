Perfect ‚Äî here are some *strong AWS security project ideas* you can actually build, script, or automate using *serverless (Lambda, EventBridge, Step Functions)* or *Python/Bash automation*.
These are practical enough to put on GitHub or write about in technical blogs.

---

## üîê 1. AWS Security Hub Auto-Remediation Framework (Serverless)

*Goal:* Automatically fix common AWS Security Hub findings using Lambda.

*Stack:*

* AWS Security Hub (findings)
* EventBridge (event triggers)
* AWS Lambda (remediation actions)
* SNS / Slack (notifications)

*Example automation:*

* When Security Hub reports ‚ÄúS3 bucket public,‚Äù trigger Lambda to:

  1. Remove public ACLs and block public access.
  2. Tag the bucket as auto-remediated=true.
  3. Notify on Slack.

*Skills shown:*
Event-driven automation, AWS SDK (boto3), IAM least privilege, and security orchestration.

---

## üß± 2. IAM Key & Role Auditor

*Goal:* Automatically detect old IAM keys and unused roles.

*Stack:*

* Lambda (Python script)
* CloudWatch (scheduler)
* SES / SNS for notifications

*Logic:*

* List all IAM users.
* Check AccessKeyLastUsed and disable keys older than 90 days.
* Identify roles with no AssumeRole activity.
* Send weekly report via email.

*Bonus:* Write results to DynamoDB or S3 for tracking over time.

---

## üß© 3. GuardDuty + Lambda Threat Response

*Goal:* Auto-respond to GuardDuty threats.

*Workflow:*

1. GuardDuty ‚Üí EventBridge ‚Üí Lambda
2. Lambda:

   * Quarantines EC2 instance (by changing SG)
   * Tags with isolated=true
   * Sends alert via Slack

*Add-on:* Create a Step Function for approval flow before isolation.

---

## üîç 4. S3 Sensitive Data Scanner (with Macie or Custom Script)

*Goal:* Detect and alert on sensitive data (PII, credentials) in S3.

*Options:*

* *Option 1:* Use Amazon Macie ‚Üí EventBridge ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí Slack
* *Option 2:* Build a custom scanner with:

  * Lambda + boto3 to iterate S3 objects
  * regex scanning (email, phone, SSN patterns)
  * Report results to DynamoDB and email summary.

---

## üß∞ 5. AWS Config Custom Rules Engine

*Goal:* Write *custom Config rules* using Lambda for compliance checks.

*Examples:*

* ‚ÄúEnsure all EBS volumes are encrypted.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúEnsure no security group has 0.0.0.0/0 on port 22.‚Äù

*Implementation:*

* Lambda (Python) checks resource compliance.
* Reports back to AWS Config as COMPLIANT / NON_COMPLIANT.

*Showcase:* CI/CD integration for automated governance.

---

## üö® 6. CloudTrail Log Integrity Checker

*Goal:* Verify CloudTrail logs for tampering or missing events.

*Steps:*

* Lambda runs daily.
* Fetches CloudTrail logs from S3.
* Verifies log file digest (using lookup-events or S3 digest validation).
* Alerts if missing logs or modified digests.

---

## üßæ 7. Serverless Security Cost Analyzer

*Goal:* Audit and track costs for security services automatically.

*Stack:*

* Lambda (Python)
* Cost Explorer API
* DynamoDB for tracking
* SNS/Slack summary

*Output:*
Daily cost per service (GuardDuty, Macie, WAF, Inspector, etc.) + monthly trend report.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 8. Terraform Security Validator (Pre-Deploy Hook)

*Goal:* Integrate AWS security scanning into Terraform CI/CD.

*Steps:*

1. GitHub Actions or CodePipeline triggers on PR.
2. Run script:

   * terraform plan
   * Scan output with tfsec / checkov
3. Post findings to Slack or GitHub PR comment.

---

## üß© 9. Lambda-based Secrets Rotation (KMS + Secrets Manager)

*Goal:* Auto-rotate DB or API secrets.

*Flow:*

* Lambda triggered by EventBridge (every 30 days)
* Generates a new password
* Updates RDS secret in Secrets Manager
* Optionally updates the application parameter in SSM

---

## üß† 10. AWS Security Drift Detector

*Goal:* Detect configuration drift against your security baseline.

*Tools:*

* Lambda (Python) + AWS Config
* DynamoDB to store baseline state
* Daily check for differences
* Email or Slack alert when deviations found

Would you like me to *pick 2‚Äì3 of these and write full GitHub-style project outlines* (README + architecture + sample code) so you can start publishing them as your own AWS security projects?
