Here are **3 recent, real-world case studies** about companies that used AWS alerting + automated action to solve security challenges. Useful for your research.

---

## 1) TUI Group — Automated Security Remediation

**Problem:**
TUI’s AWS environment had grown massively (many accounts, many regions). Security findings and misconfigurations took too long to investigate manually. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

**AWS Tools / Architecture Used:**

* AWS Security Hub (to get unified view of findings) ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* Amazon GuardDuty (for threat detection) ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* “Automated Security Response on AWS” solution (playbooks, event-driven remediation) ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* EventBridge for triggering remediations ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

**Actions Taken / Automated Response:**

* They created prebuilt + custom remediation playbooks for known security issues (unauthorized config changes, non-compliant resources). ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* Automated responses to findings (instead of manual intervention) using Security Hub + playbooks. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

**Outcomes / Benefits:**

* Saved ~156 workdays per year. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* Remediation speed improved by ~85%. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* Consistent security posture across all accounts / regions. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

## 2) Hydras / Leading Energy Company — Security Transformation

**Problem:**
A large multinational energy company was migrating many on-premise systems to AWS. They needed a cloud-native security posture, but lacked standardized tooling, visibility, and security automation. ([Hydras][2])

**AWS Tools / Architecture Used:**

* AWS Organizations (to manage accounts / governance) ([Hydras][2])
* AWS CloudTrail (logging) ([Hydras][2])
* AWS Config (for capturing assets, monitoring changes) ([Hydras][2])
* Amazon GuardDuty (threat detection) ([Hydras][2])
* AWS Security Hub (compliance posture, alert aggregation) ([Hydras][2])
* AWS Inspector, IAM Access Analyzer etc. for deeper scanning of vulnerabilities and permissions. ([Hydras][2])

**Actions Taken / Automated Response:**

* Hydras built initial proof-of-concepts to automate detection of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. ([Hydras][2])
* Integrated the security tools, automated monitoring, and alerted on risky states. ([Hydras][2])
* Embedded security consultants with developer or platform teams to help integrate secure practices continuously. ([Hydras][2])

## 3) Healthcare / Health Information Systems Provider — Continuous Security in CI/CD

**Problem:**
A global health-information-systems company needed to speed up its development / deployment pipeline (move from waterfall to agile), but they were blocked by manual security checks and post-deployment remediations. This slowed releases and increased risk due to non-compliant resources. ([mphasis.com][3])

**AWS Tools / Architecture Used:**

* AWS Config (detect non-compliant resource configurations) ([mphasis.com][3])
* AWS CloudWatch (monitoring events / metrics) ([mphasis.com][3])
* AWS Lambda (reactive remediation when non-compliance is detected) ([mphasis.com][3])
* CI/CD pipelines extended with preventive controls (e.g. config checks) and detective/reactive controls. ([mphasis.com][3])

**Actions Taken / Automated Response:**

* Non-compliant resources are automatically tagged and/or corrected via Lambda when violations are detected. ([mphasis.com][3])
* Built detection (CloudWatch, Config) that triggers remediation workflows. ([mphasis.com][3])

**Outcomes / Benefits:**

* They were able to accelerate release velocity (more frequent deployments) with higher confidence in security posture. ([mphasis.com][3])
* Improved compliance and governance, reduced manual effort & delays. ([mphasis.com][3])
