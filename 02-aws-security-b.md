| **TUI Group**                               | As their AWS footprint grew (many regions/accounts), security findings and misconfigurations across accounts were slow to investigate and fix manually. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1]) | AWS Security Hub + “Automated Security Response” solution (AWS Solutions Library), GuardDuty, EventBridge, custom playbooks. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])                               | Created/remediated specific playbooks for known scenario types (unauthorized config changes, non-compliant resources). Automated remediation of findings, standardized across accounts/regions. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1]) | Workdays saved (approx. **156 days/year**) in remediation work. Remediation speed improved by **85%**. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])                                                                        |
| **Botprise**                                | Needed to scale their internal operations & support their customers, but manual security checks/configurations were costly and slow. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])                    | AWS Security Hub, Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector. Centralization of alerts, combined with automation to remediate or escalate issues. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])                  | Automatically detect non-compliant or risky states; reduce need for manual intervention; built dashboards and workflows around findings. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])                                                        | Remediation time dropped by **~86%** average. Operational cost down around **34%**. Faster time to market. Better visibility. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])                                                 |
| **Rearc + Fortune 250 customer**            | Needed continuous compliance and risk monitoring; lacked unified visibility and automatic remediation of misconfigurations across environments. ([rearc.io][3])                          | They used AWS Well-Architected Tool assessment; AWS Security Hub; CloudTrail; AWS Config; GuardDuty; also integrated a CSPM product (Prisma Cloud) for deeper scanning. ([rearc.io][3])     | Real-time alerts from misconfigurations + behavior anomalies; automated escalations; simulated breach remediation; continuous monitoring. ([rearc.io][3])                                                                        | Achieved **100% visibility** into resource posture; could proactively find risks; better control over compliance & governance. ([rearc.io][3])                                                                 |
| **eSentire + Global Investment Org (APAC)** | Growing AWS usage across multiple accounts; many misconfigurations and alert conditions; lack of internal resources to monitor & respond. ([eSentire][4])                                | eSentire’s Managed Detection & Response (MDR) service using signals from AWS: GuardDuty, WAF & Shield, logs, etc. Setup of alerting pipelines, detection, triage, response. ([eSentire][4]) | The MDR partner monitors alerts, filters false positives, takes remediation when possible, provides 24/7 SOC oversight. ([eSentire][4])                                                                                          | A lot of misconfigurations fixed; unusual user activity detected early; customers get reliable security operations without building full in-house SOC. Better confidence in scaling AWS usage. ([eSentire][4]) |
| **IamHere Software Labs (via Rapyder)**     | A smaller/prod environment with risk of exposure due to lack of mature security monitoring; security gaps across production AWS environment. ([rapyder.com][5])                          | AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, AWS Shield, AWS Config. Audit of AWS production setup; identification of gaps; implementation of monitoring and guardrails. ([rapyder.com][5])                 | Applied best practices for guardrails; enabled detection of threats; improved environment organization; likely configured alerting and actions for misconfigurations. ([rapyder.com][5])                                         | Risks reduced; production security posture improved; better readiness for incident detection and response.
