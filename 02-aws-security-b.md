Here are **3 recent, real-world case studies** about companies that used AWS alerting + automated action to solve security challenges. Useful for your research.

---

## 1) TUI Group — Automated Security Remediation

**Problem:**
TUI’s AWS environment had grown massively (many accounts, many regions). Security findings and misconfigurations took too long to investigate manually. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

**AWS Tools / Architecture Used:**

* AWS Security Hub (to get unified view of findings) ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* Amazon GuardDuty (for threat detection) ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* “Automated Security Response on AWS” solution (playbooks, event-driven remediation) ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* EventBridge for triggering remediations ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

**Actions Taken / Automated Response:**

* They created prebuilt + custom remediation playbooks for known security issues (unauthorized config changes, non-compliant resources). ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* Automated responses to findings (instead of manual intervention) using Security Hub + playbooks. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

**Outcomes / Benefits:**

* Saved ~156 workdays per year. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* Remediation speed improved by ~85%. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])
* Consistent security posture across all accounts / regions. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

## 3) Healthcare / Health Information Systems Provider — Continuous Security in CI/CD

**Problem:**
A global health-information-systems company needed to speed up its development / deployment pipeline (move from waterfall to agile), but they were blocked by manual security checks and post-deployment remediations. This slowed releases and increased risk due to non-compliant resources. ([mphasis.com][3])

**AWS Tools / Architecture Used:**

* AWS Config (detect non-compliant resource configurations) ([mphasis.com][3])
* AWS CloudWatch (monitoring events / metrics) ([mphasis.com][3])
* AWS Lambda (reactive remediation when non-compliance is detected) ([mphasis.com][3])
* CI/CD pipelines extended with preventive controls (e.g. config checks) and detective/reactive controls. ([mphasis.com][3])

**Actions Taken / Automated Response:**

* Non-compliant resources are automatically tagged and/or corrected via Lambda when violations are detected. ([mphasis.com][3])
* Built detection (CloudWatch, Config) that triggers remediation workflows. ([mphasis.com][3])

**Outcomes / Benefits:**

* They were able to accelerate release velocity (more frequent deployments) with higher confidence in security posture. ([mphasis.com][3])
* Improved compliance and governance, reduced manual effort & delays. ([mphasis.com][3])

## 10 AWS Security Case Study Ideas (Alerting & Automated Actions)

| # | Case Study Problem (The Challenge) | Detection Tool (Alerting) | Automated Action (Solution) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.** | **Public S3 Data Exposure:** New S3 bucket galti se public access ke liye khul gaya, jismein PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data hai. | **AWS Security Hub** (ya **Macie** for PII) | **AWS Lambda** (via EventBridge) foran bucket par **Block Public Access** settings apply kar deta hai. |
| **2.** | **Unused/Old IAM Keys:** Development team ke kisi member ki access key 90 din se zyada purani ho gayi aur istemal nahi hui. | **IAM Access Analyzer** ya **AWS Lambda** (Custom Script) | **AWS Lambda** (via CloudWatch Schedule) us purani key ko **automatically disable** kar deta hai. |
| **3.** | **Vulnerable SSH Port:** EC2 instance ke Security Group mein SSH port 22 **`0.0.0.0/0`** (internet se open) ho gaya. | **AWS Config** (Custom Rule) ya **Security Hub** | **AWS Lambda** (via EventBridge) woh **insecure rule foran hata** kar use sirf approved IP range tak restrict kar deta hai. |
| **4.** | **GuardDuty Compromised Host:** GuardDuty ne EC2 instance par **Cryptocurrency Mining** ya **unusual data transfer** jaisi malicious activity detect ki. | **Amazon GuardDuty** | **AWS Lambda** (via EventBridge) compromised instance ka Security Group badal kar use **network se isolate (quarantine)** kar deta hai. |
| **5.** | **Unencrypted EBS Volumes:** Production mein ek naya EBS volume **encryption ke bagair** attach ho gaya. | **AWS Config** (Rule: `encrypted-volumes`) | **AWS Lambda** (via EventBridge) **automatic enforcement** ke liye volume ko detach kar deta hai ya uska snapshot lekar encrypted volume se replace kar deta hai. |
| **6.** | **API Key Exposure in Lambda:** Developer ne kisi Lambda function ke environment variables mein database ka **production password** daal diya. | **Amazon Macie** (for detecting secrets) ya **Security Hub** | **AWS Lambda** (via Macie/EventBridge) us environment variable se **secret value ko hata deta hai** aur notification bhejta hai. |
| **7.** | **IAM Root Account Use:** Kisi ne galti se **Root User** se koi non-administrative kaam kiya. | **AWS CloudTrail** (Log monitoring) $\to$ **Amazon CloudWatch** | **SNS/Slack Notification:** CloudWatch (Filter) $\to$ SNS (Simple Notification Service) ko trigger karke security team aur management ko **immediate alert** bhejta hai. |
| **8.** | **Overly Broad Cross-Account Trust:** Ek test account ko galti se production account ke **Admin role** par trust de diya gaya. | **IAM Access Analyzer** | **AWS Lambda** (via Security Hub Custom Action) us **Trust Policy ko revert** karke sirf zaruri (least privilege) services tak limit kar deta hai. |
| **9.** | **Manual Configuration Drift (ClickOps):** Ek critical EC2 instance manually delete ho gaya, ya uski configuration IaC se hat gayi. | **AWS Config** (ya **CloudTrail** Delete API call) | **AWS Lambda** ya **Step Functions** ko trigger karke deleted resource ko uske **last known secure state par restore** karne ki process shuru karta hai (backup ya snapshot se). |
| **10.** | **Database Secret Rotation:** Database password **manually** rotate karna mushkil hai aur purana hone par risk badhta hai. | **AWS Secrets Manager** (Rotation setting) | **AWS Secrets Manager** schedule ke mutabiq **Lambda function ko trigger** karta hai jo DB mein naya password set karta hai aur secret store ko update karta hai. |
