| Case Study | Problem Faced | AWS Tools / Architecture Used | Actions & Outcomes |
|------------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Experian – Centralizing Cloud Security for Real-Time Remediation** | Global data company Experian managed multiple cloud environments, leading to fragmented security alerts and manual remediation that focused on symptoms rather than root causes, delaying compliance and increasing risks in dynamic setups. | AWS Config for auditing and alerting on misconfigurations; AWS Lambda for event-driven auto-remediation; AWS CloudFormation for resource management; AWS Systems Manager for detailed account insights and exception handling; Amazon S3 and SQS integrated for targeted controls. | Automated near-real-time fixes for misconfigurations (e.g., encryption enforcement), reducing S3 alerts by 80% and overall alerts by 27%; remediation time dropped from 24 hours to 2-5 minutes; standardized security across 400+ accounts, boosting scalability and team focus on innovation. |
| **Botprise – Scaling Security Automation for Startups** | As a cloud security firm, Botprise struggled with manual task handling, high costs, and visibility gaps in security alerts during rapid growth, delaying remediation and market entry in mission-critical sectors like finance. | AWS Security Hub for centralizing alerts and posture management; Amazon GuardDuty for threat detection; Amazon Inspector for vulnerability scanning; AWS Well-Architected Framework for security reviews. | Centralized dashboard aggregated findings for automated responses; reduced time to remediation by 86% via no-code automations; cut operational costs by 34%; halved time to market, enabling 400% growth while meeting compliance standards. |
| **Capital One – S3 Data Breach Recovery** | Financial giant Capital One experienced a major 2019 breach from a misconfigured S3 bucket, exposing data of 100 million customers due to poor configuration management and access controls, eroding trust and highlighting cloud data risks. | AWS IAM for least-privilege policies; AWS Organizations for access controls; AWS CloudTrail for API monitoring and alerting; Encryption tools for data at rest/transit; Automated auditing for compliance checks. | Post-breach, enforced automated configs and audits to prevent misconfigurations; implemented encryption and monitoring for real-time alerts; restored trust through transparency, reduced future breach risks, and shared learnings industry-wide. |
| **Netflix – DDoS and Architecture Security** | Streaming service Netflix dealt with DDoS threats and security management in a distributed microservices setup, risking downtime and data exposure for millions of users amid scaling challenges. | AWS Shield for DDoS mitigation and alerting; Security Monkey (open-source) integrated with AWS for permission monitoring; Microservices isolation for reduced attack surface. | Automated threat detection and response minimized risks; enhanced performance with proactive monitoring; protected user data, allowing focus on content innovation without availability disruptions. |
| **Leading Bank – Unauthorized Access Mitigation** | A Fortune 500 bank faced high unauthorized access attempts across 3000 employees, lacking granular controls, which posed compliance risks and potential breaches in a regulated environment. | AWS IAM for role-based access control (RBAC) with 50+ roles; Centralized identity system with auditing; Multi-factor authentication (MFA); Continuous monitoring for real-time alerts. | Automated provisioning/de-provisioning and audits reduced unauthorized attempts by 60%; cut compliance costs by 30%; improved onboarding and accountability with usage-based role refinements. |
| **Codefinger Ransomware on AWS S3** | Ransomware group Codefinger exploited compromised AWS credentials in January 2025, targeting S3 buckets to encrypt data using server-side encryption (SSE-C), causing data loss and extortion for multiple organizations. | AWS CloudTrail for logging and alerting on suspicious activities; AWS IAM for credential rotation and least-privilege; Amazon GuardDuty for threat detection; S3 Block Public Access and encryption enforcement. | Enabled monitoring to detect unusual S3 access; automated credential rotation and backups prevented full data loss; reduced recovery time with forensic analysis, emphasizing proactive credential management to avoid similar exploits. |
| **Crimson Collective – AWS Credential Exfiltration** | Threat actors Crimson Collective used leaked long-term AWS access keys to compromise environments, exfiltrating sensitive data via services like Redshift UNLOAD to attacker-controlled S3 buckets, exploiting over-privileged creds and misconfigurations. | AWS CloudTrail and VPC endpoints for monitoring; Amazon Redshift Python connector updates; IAM least-privilege enforcement; GuardDuty for anomaly detection. | Detected unusual UNLOAD/COPY activities with alerts; rotated keys and disabled public access; chained vulnerability fixes reduced exfiltration risks by isolating tokens, improving overall credential security posture.
